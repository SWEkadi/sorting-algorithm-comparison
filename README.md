# Sorting Algorithm Comparison and Analysis

## 📌 Project Description
This project implements and compares two sorting algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort

The algorithms are tested on different types of arrays:
- Random
- Sorted
- Reverse-sorted
- Partially sorted

Their performance is evaluated by measuring:
- Execution time
- Memory usage

Results are visualized using graphs to compare performance across different input sizes and data types.
